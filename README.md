# What is the "Isle Of Trust"?

The "Isle Of Trust" game is a website game application developed initially by the students of
Portland State University in 2022.

This game is now being worked on by me and other members of PSU as its own project, however we
aren't starting from fresh. Our job for the project is to implement a fully working tutorial
(the one at the moment is just a giant text document) and to rehaul a majority of the game's
base mechanics.

# Where can I find the website?

At the moment, you can go to https://isleoftrust.org/ for the old group's code and design.
The code that my development team is currently working on is what you can find inside this
repository.
