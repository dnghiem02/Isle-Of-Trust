# Welcome to the Isle of Trust

The Isle of Trust is a react based web game designed to invoke deep thoughts on topics such as morality, influence and the greater good.

# What is the "Isle Of Trust"?

The "Isle Of Trust" game is a website game application developed initially by the students of
Portland State University in 2022, and is a react-based website game designed to portray the
Prisoner's dilemma in various personalities, in the form of an island-survival game where
people either cheat or cooperate for resources, invoking thoughts on morality and influence
of others, and working to achieve a common goal of survival on a world.

This game is now being worked on by me and other members of PSU as its own project, however we
aren't starting from fresh. Our job for the project is to implement a fully working tutorial
(the one at the moment is just a giant text document) and to rehaul a majority of the game's
base mechanics.

# Where can I find the website?

At the moment, you can go to https://isleoftrust.org/ for the old group's code and design.
